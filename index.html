            <h2>Welcome to World of Digital Art.....</h2>
            <p style="font-size: larger;">A digital art gallery is a modern platform—either online or in physical
                spaces—where artworks created or
                displayed using digital technology are showcased. Unlike traditional galleries that primarily exhibit
                paintings, sculptures, or photography, digital art galleries focus on art forms born from or enhanced by
                technology.</p>
